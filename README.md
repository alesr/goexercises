### FUNCTIONS

```
func BinaryGap(n int) int
    BinaryGap -
    https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/binary_gap/ Find
    longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.

func CyclicRotation(arr []int, rotation int) []int
    CyclicRotation -
    https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/cyclic_rotation/
    Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.

func EvenFibonacci(limit int) int
    EvenFibonacci - https://projecteuler.net/problem=2 Each new term in the
    Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By
    starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,
    21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence
    whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued
    terms.

func FizzBuzzWoof(n, d1, d2, d3 int) string
    FizzBuzzWoof receives n, d1, d2, d3 as positive integer as arguments and
    returns:

	Fizz -> if n is divisible by d1
	Buzz -> if n is divisible by d2
	Woof -> if n is divisible by d3
	FizzBuzz -> if n is divisible by d1 and d2
	FizzWoof -> if n is divisible by d1 and d3
	BuzzWoof -> if n is divisible by d2 and d3
	FizzBuzzWoof -> if n is divisible by d1 and d2 and d3
	string(n) -> if n is not evenly divisible by any given divisor

func FrogJmp(x, y, d int) int
    FrogJmp -
    https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/frog_jmp/
    Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.

func LargestPalindromeProd(n int) int
    LargestPalindromeProd - https://projecteuler.net/problem=4 A palindromic
    number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the
    product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest
    palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

func LargestPrimeFactor(n int) int
    LargestPrimeFactor - https://projecteuler.net/problem=3 The prime
    factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor
    of the number 600851475143?

func MultiplesOf(n int) int
    MultiplesOf - Multiples of 3 and 5 https://projecteuler.net/problem=1 If
    we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
    we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of
    all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

func OddOccurrences(arr []int) int
    OddOccurrences -
    https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/odd_occurrences_in_array/start/
    Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.

func PermCheck(slice []int) int
    PermCheck -
    https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/perm_check/
    Check whether array A is a permutation.

func PermMissingElem(arr []int) int
    PermMissingElem -
    https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/perm_missing_elem/
    Find the missing element in a given permutation.

func Prime10001(n int) int
    Prime10001 - https://projecteuler.net/problem=7 By listing the first six
    prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is
    13. What is the 10 001st prime number?

func SmallestMultiple(n int) int
    SmallestMultiple - https://projecteuler.net/problem=5 2520 is the
    smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10
    without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is
    evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

func SumSqrDiff(n int) int
    SumSqrDiff - https://projecteuler.net/problem=6 The sum of the squares
    of the first ten natural numbers is, 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385 The
    square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... +
    10)2 = 552 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of
    the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 =
    2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
    one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

func TapeEquilibrium(slice []int) int
    TapeEquilibrium -
    https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/tape_equilibrium/
    Minimize the value `|(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|`
```
